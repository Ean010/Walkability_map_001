# Walkability_map_001

Walkability_map_001 is an interactive mapping project designed to visualize and analyze the walkability of urban areas. By combining geospatial data with user-friendly visualizations, this project aims to help city planners, researchers, and residents better understand the accessibility and pedestrian-friendliness of different neighborhoods.

## Key Features

- Interactive map interface for exploring walkability scores
- Integration of multiple data sources (e.g., sidewalks, crosswalks, points of interest)
- Customizable filters to highlight different aspects of walkability
- Export and sharing options for map views and data

## Intended Audience

This project is ideal for urban planners, GIS professionals, researchers, students, and anyone interested in improving or studying urban walkability.

## Technologies Used

- Python, JavaScript, and web mapping libraries (e.g., Leaflet or Mapbox)
- GeoJSON and other geospatial data formats
- Data processing and analysis tools

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions to launch the map locally or deploy it online.
